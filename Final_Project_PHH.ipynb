        "# Analyzing Public Sentiment Towards Senator Tuberville's Blockade of Military Promotions\n",
        "\n",
        "##Introduction\n",
        "Following the overturning of the Roe v. Wade ruling, a significant issue arose for military service members stationed in states where abortions are illegal, preventing them from accessing essential reproductive health care. Addressing this concern, on October 20, 2022, the Department of Defense (DoD) countered by unveiling a new policy to facilitate access to non-covered reproductive health care for its service members and their families ([Department of Defense, 2023](www.defense.gov/News/Releases/Release/Article/3301006/dod-releases-policies-to-ensure-access-to-non-covered-reproductive-health-care/)). This groundbreaking policy grants service members the necessary time off, travel allowances, and support to seek reproductive health care outside their current stationed state. However, the introduction of this policy faced opposition from Alabama Senator Tommy Tuberville.\n",
        "\n",
        "In protest of the new DoD policy, Senator Tuberville initiated a blockade on senior military promotions across the DoD. Annually, the Senate approves over 50,000 military nominations and promotions, conducted in batches for efficiency. Typically, the Senate can unanimously approve an entire list at once. Nevertheless, Senators have the option to demand roll call votes, deliberating on each name individually—a choice that significantly prolongs the approval process for these nominations.\n",
        "\n",
        "Senator Tuberville has enforced the option for roll call votes on a batch of the most senior leadership positions in the military. It was initially estimated that over 600 military leadership positions would be unfilled by the end of 2023. As such, unfilled senior billeted positions gapped from this blockade will severely diminish national security. The holdout remained consistent for over 9 months. However, as of December 6th, 2023, after facing significant bipartisan backlash from his colleagues and constituents, Senator Tuberville has dropped the hold on over 430 military promotions ([Shane, 2023](https://www.navytimes.com/news/pentagon-congress/2023/12/05/tuberville-drops-holds-on-more-than-430-military-promotions/)).\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite the lifting of Senator Tuberville's blockade, lingering concerns persist due to the delayed promotions. These issues encompass a hurried process to officially promote 430 senior military officers in formal ceremonies, determining back-pay for the promotions, relocating these officers to their new permanent duty stations, and, most crucially, enabling them to assume their new roles in directing policies and procedures commensurate with their positions. These residual concerns are not exhaustive, and many have yet to be previously considered, given that this blockade marked the first of its kind.\n",
        "\n",
        "###Research Question and Objective\n",
        "This research paper will utilize data science methods to develop a deeper understanding of public sentiment towards leveraging the United States' national security to enforce changes in political policies. Specifically, the overall objective is to determine whether there is bipartisan support or opposition to Senator Tuberville's blockade of military promotions due to its potential to jeopardize the United States' national security. As such, to achieve this objective, the research will seek to answer the following questions:\n",
        ">1. Is there a collective sentiment across politically polarized media sources regarding Senator Tuberville's blockade of military promotions?\n",
        ">2. Has the sentiment changed or shifted over the last 10 months? If so in which way?\n",
        "\n",
        "###Data Collection\n",
        "For this research, I will employ the YouTube Application Programming Interface (API) to conduct sentiment and keyword analyses on comments from news videos covering Senator Tuberville's blockade. These videos will be selected from media sources situated at opposing ends of the political spectrum. According to a Pew Research Center Poll on political polarization media habits, 78% of predominantly conservative and consistently conservative web users rely on Fox News as their primary source for government and political news. In contrast, 35% of survey participants prefer CNN News for their government and political news ([Mitchell, Gottfried, Kiley and Matsa, 2014](https://www.pewresearch.org/journalism/2014/10/21/political-polarization-media-habits/)).\n",
        "\n",
        "To ensure a comprehensive analysis, two videos from each media source will be chosen for this study. One video from each outlet will represent preliminary reports prior to Senator Tuberville's blockade being lifted, while the other will be selected from a timeframe after the blockade has been dropped. This approach aims to capture potential shifts in sentiment across the two distinct periods, offering insights into the evolving public perception of the events surrounding the blockade.\n",
        "\n",
        "From YouTube, the following videos were selected:\n",
        "1. Alabama Senator Holding Up Military Promotions, Fox News, September 7th, 2023\n",
        "2. Alabama Senator Tuberville Blocks Hundreds of Military Promotions, Creating National Security Concern, Fox News, December 6th, 2023\n",
        "3. Three military leaders make rare joint appearance to demand action from senator, CNN, September 5th 2023\n",
        "4. Tuberville says he will release holds on military nominations three-star and below, CNN, December 5th, 2023\n",
        "\n",
        ">Link to original videos:\n",
        ">1. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=201JSBJVaXg\n",
        ">2. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OMwDXP0QmF8\n",
        ">3. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RBhcxhzGltI\n",
        ">4. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J3GS2nchryE\n",
        "\n",
        "###Hypothesis\n",
        "I hypothesize that despite the political differences between the different media sources and their viewers, an overwhelming majority of people are opposed to using the military promotions and national security to leverage discourse for political policy divergences. Thus, my hypothesis to research questions is that there will be shared negative sentiment against the videos reporting the blockade of military promotions. Furthermore, the videos subsequent Senator Tuberville's removal of the blockades will receive a more positive outlook.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Significance and Implications to Public Policy\n",
        "This topic holds significant relevance to public policy for multiple reasons. Initially, Senator Tuberville's blockade on military promotions has resulted in substantial delays in filling essential senior military leadership positions within the Department of Defense (DoD). As geopolitical tensions escalate, particularly in the Indo-Pacific Region with China and amidst the Palestine-Israel conflict in the Middle East, the prolonged vacancies in senior military roles pose significant threats to both current and future U.S. national security. Consequently, issues on military readiness and security will become critical concerns for any government's public policy agenda.\n",
        "\n",
        "Moreover, this research project delves into the broader concern of the politicization of national security. The importance of maintaining bipartisan support on military matters is underscored, emphasizing the need for collaborative and non-partisan approaches to ensure the nation's security interests are adequately addressed. By examining the implications of Senator Tuberville's actions within this context, the study contributes valuable insights to the ongoing discourse on the intersection of politics and national security policy.\n",
        "\n",
        "##Data Analysis\n",
        "###Step One: Data Collection\n",
        "For the first step, I saved the comments for the four videos into individual .csv files. I chose to exclude the replies based on the belief that the sentiment for the reply would be in relation to the original user's comment rather than the video itself. The number of comments per video varied significantly. The following are the number of comments per video imported into the .csv file. There was difficulty finding a Fox New video that was released prior to the removal of the blockade that had multiple comments.\n",
        ">1. Video 1: 27 Comments\n",
        ">2. Video 2: 456 Comments\n",
        ">3. Video 3: 754 Comments\n",
        ">4. Video 4: 456 Comments\n",

Following the Sentiment Analysis lesson and utilizing assistance from ChatGPT, I introduced a sentiment_score column displaying the compound sentiment analysis score for each comment. [(ChatGPT, 2023)](https://chat.openai.com/share/b550013a-ae48-40c8-8e37-3a5f2ed5f09a) I also incorporated a new bottom row to compute the average compound sentiment score for each video.\n",

This scrutiny aims to objectively assess potential inaccuracies arising from sarcasm or similar textual nuances, which have been identified as common challenges with the VADER library.\n",

        "In the final phase, I generated an overall count per video, categorizing sentiments into positive, neutral, and negative. This comprehensive approach ensures a robust evaluation of sentiment distribution within the dataset, accounting for both positive and negative sentiments with a critical eye on potential inaccuracies."

I think a better point to make would be why can't we attract better people to fill up important positions in DC? The reason we can't attract better people to Washington DC is because we have people working there now like Tuckerville! If you really love a country, like you say, you do pay attention to who you're sending to DC to fill important positions in a federal government.\" Score: .9803\n",

Big money, mega wealthy, 1% what's motivating Fox News? It's a big smokescreen to keep us from focusing on the real issues! Corporate greed!\" Score: .9114\n",

        "\n",
        "The analysis of public sentiment towards Senator Tuberville's blockade of military promotions provides valuable insights into the complex interplay between politics, national security, and public opinion. The research, conducted through sentiment analysis of YouTube comments on politically polarized media sources, aimed to understand the evolving perspectives over a 10-month period.\n",
        "\n",
        "The sentiment analysis results revealed a predominantly negative sentiment across three of the four selected videos. However, Video 1 exhibited a positive average sentiment score, challenging the overall trend. This deviation was attributed to the limited number of comments in Video 1, raising concerns about the impact of sample size on sentiment analysis outcomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Furthermore, an in-depth examination of comments with the highest positive sentiment scores uncovered inaccuracies in the sentiment analysis tool, particularly in instances of sarcasm and nuanced language. This highlights a limitation in relying solely on automated sentiment analysis tools, emphasizing the importance of human review to ensure the accuracy of results.\n",
        "\n",
        "Despite the lifting of Senator Tuberville's blockade, concerns persist about the delayed promotions and the subsequent challenges in addressing the backlog. The research underscores the broader implications of using military promotions as a political tool, emphasizing the need for bipartisan support in matters of national security.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, the study provides a nuanced understanding of public sentiment, revealing both shared concerns and variations in perspectives. The findings contribute to the ongoing discourse on the intersection of politics and national security policy, urging policymakers to consider the broader implications of their actions on military readiness and security. Additionally, the research highlights the importance of refining sentiment analysis methodologies to accurately capture the complexities of public opinion in the digital age."
