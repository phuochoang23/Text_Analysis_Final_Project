##Abstract
This research paper examines public sentiment towards Senator Tuberville's blockade of military promotions, initiated in response to the Department of Defense's new policy on reproductive health care for service members. The study utilizes data science methods to analyze comments on politically polarized media sources, aiming to understand the evolving perspectives over a 10-month period. The sentiment analysis results reveal predominantly negative sentiment across three of the four selected videos, with Video 1 exhibiting a positive average sentiment score, challenging the overall trend. However, concerns arise about the impact of sample size on sentiment analysis outcomes, as Video 1 had a limited number of comments. Additionally, an in-depth examination of comments with the highest positive sentiment scores highlights inaccuracies in automated sentiment analysis tools, emphasizing the need for human review. Despite the lifting of the blockade, lingering concerns about delayed promotions underscore the broader implications of using military promotions as a political tool, urging policymakers to consider the need for bipartisan support in matters of national security. The findings contribute to the ongoing discourse on the intersection of politics and national security policy and emphasize the importance of refining sentiment analysis methodologies to accurately capture the complexities of public opinion in the digital age.
